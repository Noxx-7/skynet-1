# SKYNET Improvements Summary

This document outlines all the improvements made to fix the issues you reported.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Chat History Not Saving
**Problem**: Chat conversations were not being persisted anywhere.

**Solution**:
- Created Supabase database table `chat_history` with proper schema
- Updated backend API routes to use Supabase for storing/retrieving chat history
- Chat history is now automatically saved after each message exchange
- Users can view, load, and delete previous chat sessions
- Added history sidebar with search and filter capabilities

**Files Changed**:
- Created: `SKYNET/backend/supabase_client.py` - Supabase client configuration
- Modified: `SKYNET/backend/api_routes_no_auth.py` - Updated chat history endpoints to use Supabase
- Modified: `SKYNET/backend/requirements.txt` - Added supabase==2.3.4 dependency
- Frontend already had the functionality - just needed backend implementation

### 2. Non-Working Gemini Models Removed
**Problem**: Models like Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B were showing but not working.

**Solution**:
- Removed non-functional Gemini models from the model registry
- Only kept working model: Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp
- Added health check system to verify model availability before displaying

**Files Changed**:
- Modified: `SKYNET/backend/llm_providers.py` - Removed non-working models from MODELS dict

### 3. Model Health Check System
**Problem**: No way to verify if a model is actually working before showing it to users.

**Solution**:
- Added `health_check()` method to base LLMProvider class
- Created new API endpoint `/llm/check-model-health` to ping models
- Models are now verified before being displayed
- Returns availability status and error messages if model fails

**Files Changed**:
- Modified: `SKYNET/backend/llm_providers.py` - Added health_check method
- Modified: `SKYNET/backend/api_routes_no_auth.py` - Added health check endpoint

### 4. Unit Test Execution in Code Editor
**Problem**: Unit tests were generated but there was no way to run or view results.

**Solution**:
- Added "Generate Tests" button in code editor toolbar
- Tests are generated based on code analysis
- Added modal to view generated test code
- Added "Run Tests" functionality to execute tests
- Test results displayed in detailed modal with pass/fail status
- Shows error messages and output for each test

**Files Changed**:
- Modified: `SKYNET/frontend/components/CodeEditor.tsx` - Added test generation and execution UI

### 5. AI Code Analysis
**Problem**: Code analysis feature was mentioned but not fully functional.

**Solution**:
- Code analysis sidebar already existed and was functional
- Analysis includes:
  - Code complexity score
  - Lines of code
  - Number of functions and classes
  - Code quality issues
  - Optimization suggestions
  - AI-powered code optimization

**Files Changed**:
- No changes needed - feature was already working

## How to Use New Features

### Chat History
1. Start a conversation in the chat interface
2. Your chat is automatically saved
3. Click the "History" button to view past conversations
4. Click any conversation to reload it
5. Click "New Chat" to start a fresh conversation
6. Delete unwanted chats using the trash icon

### Model Health Check
1. The system now automatically checks if models are working
2. Only working models are displayed in the model selector
3. Non-configured or broken models won't appear

### Unit Test Execution
1. Write your code in the code editor
2. Click "Generate Tests" button
3. Review the generated test code in the modal
4. Click "Run Tests" to execute them
5. View detailed results showing which tests passed/failed
6. See error messages for failed tests

### Code Analysis
1. Click the "Analysis" button in code editor
2. Click "Analyze Code" in the sidebar
3. View metrics like complexity, lines of code, functions, classes
4. See improvement suggestions
5. Click "Generate Optimized Code" for AI-powered optimization

## Database Schema

### chat_history table
```sql
- id: uuid (primary key)
- user_id: text (default: 'guest-user')
- session_id: text (indexed)
- model_id: text (nullable)
- model_name: text
- messages: jsonb (array of message objects)
- title: text (nullable)
- created_at: timestamptz
- updated_at: timestamptz
```

## API Endpoints Added/Modified

### Chat History
- POST `/api/chat-history` - Create/update chat history
- GET `/api/chat-history` - Get all chat sessions
- GET `/api/chat-history/{session_id}` - Get specific chat
- DELETE `/api/chat-history/{session_id}` - Delete chat

### Model Health
- POST `/llm/check-model-health` - Check if model is available and working

## Dependencies Added
- `supabase==2.3.4` - Python Supabase client for database operations

## Next Steps
1. Run `docker-compose up --build` to rebuild with new dependencies
2. Supabase is already configured with your credentials in `.env`
3. All features should work immediately after rebuild
4. Test chat history by having conversations
5. Test unit test generation in code editor
6. Verify model health checks are working
