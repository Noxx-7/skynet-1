LLM IDE Platform - Complete Documentation
🚀 Overview
LLM IDE Platform is a comprehensive web-based IDE for testing, developing, and collaborating with Large Language Models. The platform allows users to test API-based models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) and upload custom models without requiring high-performance hardware. It includes a powerful Python code editor with automatic unit test generation, performance profiling, and real-time collaboration features.
